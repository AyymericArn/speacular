# Speacular

The MVP for a self-care app, which detects the emotionnal intents in your voice each morning in order to provide a daily advice based on it.

## Get the project running
Clone the repo, cd into it and
```
npm i
```
then 
```
npm run serve
```
## Use Speacular

### Important

Due to some audio encoding differences between browsers, the recorder function may not work as expected everywhere. It is fully functionnal on localhost, Firefox 70, Windows 10 ; you may face an empty recording bug on Chrome. Not tested on linux and mobile for the moment. The bug will be transparent anyway. The experience is optimal on a phone-like responsive size.

To test the project, be sure to have a voice recording device plugged to your machine (a basic webcam mic should do it, as well as the default mic of your phone). Be sure to be online !

* Provide your name so that Speacular can say Hello to you.
* Press the Recorder button. If you're not offline, an inspirationnal quote will appear.
* Read the quote but don't be too long ! Speacular can only treat **10 seconds of recording** to work fine for the moment.
* Let the service process your recording. An advice for the day will be printed according to the dominating mood in your voice !
* Keep track of how well your moods are going through time into Analytics section
* Keep track of the quotes you read in the past in the History section
